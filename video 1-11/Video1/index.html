        <h2>About Bali</h2>
    
<P><strong>Bali</strong> is one of the few places around the world where you can buy authentic Kopi Luwak  one of the most expensive coffees in the world.<br>
Kopi Luwak is collected from the droppings of the Luwak, a shy forest animal that prowls around coffee plantations eating coffee beans.<br>
As the Luwak cannot digest the beans, they are collected in their droppings, having picked up a unique taste as a result of their journey through the Luwaks digestive system.<br></P>
<p><strong>Bali</strong> has two different calendar systems the saka calendar, based on lunar cycles, and the 210-day pawukon calendar, said to originate from rice growing cycles.<br>
Each year, to mark the start of the Saka year, the Balinese enjoy Nyepi, a public holiday encompassing total silence, meditation and fasting.<br>
The entire island shuts down for the day, and no travelling, work or noise of any kind is permitted.<br>
</p>
<p>Balinese people will usually possess one of 4 first names: Wayan, Made, Nyoman or Ketut.<br>
Translated, these mean "first born", "second born", "third born" and "fourth born".<br>
The same names are given to both males and females.<br>
Balinese babies are not allowed to touch the ground until they are three months old.<br></p>
