      <br></br>
      Kuta Beach is suitable as a place for play around with family, relax, swim, and surf. Kuta Beach has good wave for surf activities including surf lesson where the beginner surfer up to professional have ever experienced. The beauty of Kuta Beach is complemented by the spectacular sunrise that creates the romantic nuance that alluring every visitor.
<br></br>
What once was a mere ‘backyard’ of a sleepy Balinese fishing village, with cow grazing fields and seaside coconut groves, has evolved over the decades as a front showcase of a one-stop beach holiday destination, with accommodation ranging from cheap guesthouses to five-star hotels and resorts, plus thriving bars, nightclubs and (in recent years) multi-storey shopping malls nearby. Despite the modern and urbanised feel of Jalan Pantai Kuta, the main beach road that runs parallel the coastline, the beach of Kuta continues to appeal – it’s still a place for Bali’s magical sunsets.
<br></br>
Hit the beach in the early mornings, you can claim a spot on the sand, together with surfers steadily watching for the perfect swells as the action takes place on the waves. Throughout the day, troupes of beach vendors and masseuses will all vie for your attention, be it for a beach sarong or a cheap massage, aka ‘spa treatment,’ on the sand.

During and after sunset, it’s a greatly mixed scene: friendly beach soccer matches that you can join, spontaneous ‘beach bars’ selling cold Bintangs and local bites, chats with locals, djembe drumming jam sessions and even fire dancers. Kuta Beach focal point is its central section, aptly named ‘Halfway’. Here, you only need to cross the Jalan Pantai to Kuta Beachwalk, the premier modern shopping, dining and entertainment complex, filled with numerous tenants.
